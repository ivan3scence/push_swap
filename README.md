# push_swap
The Push swap project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project:

data must be sorted.

You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions
to manipulate both stacks.

Your goal? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays
on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions,
that sorts the integers received as arguments.
